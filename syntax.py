#variable syntax in python(# repesents a comment)
#names of vaiables should not start with a special character (e.g #number=10)
#variable names should not start with a numerical number, e.g (1 number, 2number) 
#however number1, number2 is a valid syntax
#a variable name should not have spaces
#composite variable names should be separated by an underscore e.g(my_age)
#or if you are not using an underscore you could use cmel-case notation e.g (myAge, myName)
#names should not start with capital letters unless they are fuctions
#we should use realable names e.g (when dealingwith a customer, call them mycustomer, when dealing with numbers use num1,num2)
#use shorter names e.g (cust for customers, age instead of myage)
#variable names should not be repeated in different forms because python is case sensitive, e.g (Name and name are not the same)
name="burani"
age=20
gender="female"
print(gender)
#declaring variables is a process of naming computer memory spsces
#intializing variables iste process of giving variables a value e. ('age' is a variable, '26' is its value)
country="uganda"
#the "=" is called the assignment operator  in programming language
