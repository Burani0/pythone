#OOP - Object Oriented Programming
#OOP is an idea that advocates developing based on real world objects
# classes vs objects
#oop principles
#polymorphism
#inheritance
#abstraction
#encapsulation

# a class is a blue print of an object(original copy of something)
#e.g class car has objects such as benz , toyota,range rovers etc.
#class phone has objects such as itel , nokia,etc.
#objects take on all features of a class but each object has different attributes/characteristics
#an object is an istance of a class

#attributes of a class animal are, name, color, number of legs
#an object should have one or more attributes of a given class

#if you want to identify the class of an object "is a"
#toshiba is an object,laptop is a class
#victoria is an object,lake is a class

#abstraction refers to ability to ignore other details and concetrate on the highest level of representation
#abstract helps in identifying classes
#class name must be singular e.g cclass car not cars then the objects of class car are cars

#inheritance here we have the concept of parent and child

#toyota is a child of a car
#sumsang is a child of a phone
#inheritence is the ability for an object to take on different attributes of a class
#S7 belongs to class sumsang and yet sumsang belongs to class phones

#polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on different forms

#the ability to have what to share and what not to share is encapsulation
 #write 2 dynamic fuctions that prompt a user to input name age,email and gender and it prints it out
 #2nd function should prompt the user the rate of nssf tax which is 11% of the income ,PAYE tax which is a 30% of the income, and then the amount of income which is 3,000,000 then print out the net salary
